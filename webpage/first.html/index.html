<h2>“There are two spiritual dangers in not owning a farm. One is the danger of supposing that 
    breakfast comes from the grocery, and the other that heat comes from the furnace.”</h2>

    “Why do farmers farm, given their economic adversities on top of the many frustrations and 
    difficulties normal to farming? And always the answer is: "Love. They must do it for love." 
    Farmers farm for the love of farming. They love to watch and nurture the growth of plants. 
    They love to live in the presence of animals. They love to work outdoors. They love the weather, 
    maybe even when it is making them miserable. They love to live where they work and to work where 
    they live.
